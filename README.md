# Emoji Credibility Indicators
At [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com), we believe transparency with the reader is the key to building trust between writer and reader. To give readers as much transparency as possible, we wanted to create quick and easy ways to tell the reader information they might want to know about a story before reading it.

This could be something as simple as telling the reader if the story is a news piece or an opinion piece. On the other hand, there are more complicated things we might want to communicate to the reader, such as whether or not the writer has a vested interest in the companies they’re writing about, or if they used AI to write the piece.

To accomplish these goals, we’ve launched [Emoji Credibility Indicators](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/emoji-credibility-indicators)! We've open sourced them here and [on Figma as Emoji Credibility Indicators | Pixelated Emoji Pack by HackerNoon](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1360294413073459375/pixelated-emoji-pack-emoji-credibility-indicators-by-hackernoon)

## Why Adding Context to Content Matters to the Future of Digital Text
When lost in a good read, it may feel like there are only words, but the reality is, no text exists in a vacuum. All text has a setting. Too often on social media and the current internet, what surrounds the text is vanity metrics designed to keep you in the newsfeed, designed to re-affirm that what you’re doing is liked/upvoted/not-a-waste-of-time, instead of being designed to provide you with structured indications that define the context of the story.
